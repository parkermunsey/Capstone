Monday 2/2/2026

Progress:
I met with my client and talked through different options and directions for the project. That conversation helped narrow the focus to something that is both realistic and useful. I also created an initial data schema to map out what fields I expect to work with and how the data might be structured once collected and cleaned. In addition, I have continued reaching out to others connected to the data side of this topic to better understand what sources may be available and what limitations I might face.

Problems:
I still need to work on the flow chart of how I am going to scrap the data and clean it.  Keeping it sustainable is the main goal as of now.   

Plans:
My goal this week is to gather all my sources for the data and pull all successfully while running some steps on cleaning.  I would also like to research and find out a good way to look for scam postings and flush them out.  I will meet on Friday with my client again to show what I have come up with during the week. 

Hours: 2

Monday 1/26/26

Progress:
I met with John Chandler and discussed different options and directions for my project. The conversation helped clarify what might be realistic and valuable to focus on. I have also continued reaching out to people connected to the data side of this topic so I can better define the scope of the project.

Problems:
I still need to meet with Andrew and Sam to get a clearer understanding of what data will actually be available for me to use. Until I confirm that, it is a little difficult to fully lock in the direction and technical plan for the project.

Plans:
My goal this week is to meet with Andrew and Sam, secure access to the data I will be using, and begin the data cleaning process. Once I understand the structure and quality of the data, I will start outlining the analysis and project workflow.

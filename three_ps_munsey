Progress:
I met with Kristian and reviewed potential feature additions as well as areas where we should simplify the scope. That discussion helped tighten the focus of the MVP and clarify what actually delivers value versus 
what may be unnecessary at this stage. On the technical side, I created a new subpoena database and successfully built and ran an ETL process to load data into it.

Problems:
The main challenge right now is scraping Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace in a reliable and sustainable way. Both platforms present structural and policy limitations that make automation difficult. 
I have invested about four hours into testing different approaches, but the process is still not stable enough for production use. Balancing completeness of sources with long term maintainability continues to be a concern.

Plans:
My focus this week is to continue working toward successfully scraping all targeted sources and integrating them into a consistent ingestion pipeline. I want to stabilize the scraping logic, improve error handling,
and ensure the ETL process can handle multiple inputs cleanly. Once the sources are consistently loading, I will shift attention toward cleaning rules and standardizing fields across platforms.

Progress:
I set up a new PostgreSQL database dedicated to the project, created the initial schema for housing listings and data ingestion, and established a clean project folder structure with version control. I also began outlining the ingestion pipeline in Python and identified which data sources are realistic and sustainable to work with in an initial MVP. In parallel, I coordinated with my client and rescheduled our first project meeting, aligning expectations around the current build stage.

Problems:
At this stage, the primary challenge is balancing ambition with feasibility. Some of the largest housing platforms present technical and policy limitations, so I need to be thoughtful about which sources to include early on while still delivering meaningful value in the demo.

Plans:
My focus for the coming week is to build a live proof of concept that pulls rental listings from at least one viable source and writes them into the database. I plan to demonstrate this workflow to the client during our Friday meeting. I will also continue refining the ingestion logic, document assumptions and constraints for each data source, and begin thinking through simple filtering rules for identifying duplicate or suspicious listings.

Monday 2/2/2026

Progress:
I met with my client and talked through different options and directions for the project. That conversation helped narrow the focus to something that is both realistic and useful. I also created an initial data schema to map out what fields I expect to work with and how the data might be structured once collected and cleaned. In addition, I have continued reaching out to others connected to the data side of this topic to better understand what sources may be available and what limitations I might face.

Problems:
I still need to work on the flow chart of how I am going to scrap the data and clean it.  Keeping it sustainable is the main goal as of now.   

Plans:
My goal this week is to gather all my sources for the data and pull all successfully while running some steps on cleaning.  I would also like to research and find out a good way to look for scam postings and flush them out.  I will meet on Friday with my client again to show what I have come up with during the week. 

Hours: 2

Monday 1/26/26

Progress:
I met with John Chandler and discussed different options and directions for my project. The conversation helped clarify what might be realistic and valuable to focus on. I have also continued reaching out to people connected to the data side of this topic so I can better define the scope of the project.

Problems:
I still need to meet with Andrew and Sam to get a clearer understanding of what data will actually be available for me to use. Until I confirm that, it is a little difficult to fully lock in the direction and technical plan for the project.

Plans:
My goal this week is to meet with Andrew and Sam, secure access to the data I will be using, and begin the data cleaning process. Once I understand the structure and quality of the data, I will start outlining the analysis and project workflow.

Hours:2

Monday 1/19/26

Progress:
I have since changed my project to working with homeless data for the City of Missoula. I have contacted Sam Hilliard, who I have worked with in the past, to help identify a client and secure better data. I have also scheduled a meeting with John Chandler on Thursday 1/22 to discuss my options for this project.

Problems:
Switching projects has put me a little behind, but I am working on making that up this week. Sam Hilliard has gotten back to me and said she is busy but will respond soon to my email. It may be a good idea to put together a plan B in case she is unable to help.

Plans:
After talking with John Chandler, my plan is to start working on an outline and begin gathering and cleaning data for the project this weekend.

Hours:
Approximately 3 hours were spent working on the project this past week.

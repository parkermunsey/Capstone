Monday 1/19/26

Progress:
I have since changed my project to working with homeless data for the City of Missoula. I have contacted Sam Hilliard, who I have worked with in the past, to help identify a client and secure better data. I have also scheduled a meeting with John Chandler on Thursday 1/22 to discuss my options for this project.

Problems:
Switching projects has put me a little behind, but I am working on making that up this week. Sam Hilliard has gotten back to me and said she is busy but will respond soon to my email. It may be a good idea to put together a plan B in case she is unable to help.

Plans:
After talking with John Chandler, my plan is to start working on an outline and begin gathering and cleaning data for the project this weekend.

Hours:
Approximately 3 hours were spent working on the project this past week.
